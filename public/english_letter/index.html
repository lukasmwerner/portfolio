Sure I had some challenges but I gained so much out of it. Much of what I experienced in this short time was just by stumbling into them by accident. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Having done some sports in middle school I figured that I should have a shot at trying some track &amp; field. Boy was I in for a surprise. I never expected the daily practices, the long meets, and the stiff competition. Yet I will never forget those 4x100, 4x400, and 400-meter races. Especially after my best 400-meter race; where I felt like I was going to pass out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Finding people with who I enjoyed hanging out was something that I had not really predicted how simple it would be. One of my best friends I met in the line to get my photo taken on my first freshman day. Many of my other friends I found out of the blue in classes and in shared spaces such as the gym, art room, science rooms, and the maker space. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Projects have been a MASSIVE part of my high school experience, from the synthesizer and Rube Goldberg machine I built for physics class or the Iron Man helmet I 3D printed or the various different computer-related projects I did in my free time. These projects have become some of my most prized memories and have now become pillars in my life. Early on I was able to make a name for myself by taking supplemental classes that allowed me to learn whatever I needed for my projects. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">These projects propelled my learning and allowed me to get multiple internships. Each of those has allowed me to get a glimpse into how the corporate world compares to the academic world. &nbsp;But it has allowed me to develop a portfolio of work that I can now present to employers and colleges which make me that much more valuable to hire. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Naturally my years at La Salle have been tainted by the time spent with the coronavirus pandemic. Heading into the early pandemic there was definitely a massive fear on what we would be living through. Spending those unstructured times finding time to work on an assignment, take a break, amd work on preventing mental exhaustion. The pandemic made it abunduntly clear that I needed others to help me propell my effort to continue. Entering into junior year online I was more able to handle this new reality of digital learning and adapted to this. Returning back to school made it difficult for me to get the learning material I needed to succeed. I was again only able to persevere through this difficult time by relying on my friends, teachers, and family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">While I have definitely highlighted many of the great memories and experiences I have had. I would also like to give a word of encouragement for those hard moments. Because those hard moments can be deep and it can feel like there is no escaping it. Honestly, I&rsquo;ve encountered these every year. But the only thing I have noticed getting through those is having a strong body of friends and teachers to rely on. If you ask for help almost 100% of the time they will help out. Getting through those will feel much more rewarding in the end and feel like you have slain the dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With much luck,</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 222.47px; height: 62.39px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 222.47px; height: 62.39px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Class of 2022</span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
