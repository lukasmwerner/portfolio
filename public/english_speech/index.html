May</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">English IV</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5 May 2022</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Graduation Speech</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hi so many of you may know me from my tech antics. Building different apps and websites for people, well really just doing tons of crazy stuff. Others may only know me from the last 1 &frac12; years where I have taken a position at the falconer where I now manage all the media there. So you may have seen me at your games taking some photos. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">High school is one of those things that everyone always talks about. I have heard numerous people reminisce or talk about their high school experiences. And why not? Right? Many of us spend four years together building friendships, doing things, experiencing things and everything else that we will never forget. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well as we all know there seems to be this giant canyon in our experience. This dense fog that seems to make it impossible to see what happened during those dark years of the *COVID*.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it seems that this moment of COVID will be our impactful moment that will last a generation. If it weren&rsquo;t for amazing journalists in these 2&frac12; years not only making that important first draft of history, but keeping us informed how the virus is moving and reacting around the globe. And because of their great work we will never forget those who suffered during the racial violence reckoning after George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the violence that Asian Americans have faced, the unjust war in Ukraine, and the ever worsening climate catastrophe.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;It seems that we have no shortage of issues that our generation needs to face. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why is it that I need to give a speech reflecting on these years? </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because they are just that important. Those challenges. What we face. Will surely rock us to our core, make us work every day. We will take what we learned about morality, math, english, science, and arts. This knowledge that we have gained will help bring us through these difficult times we face ahead. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Look around you; there are people here that will go on to truly shape the world. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now my time at La Salle has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. I&rsquo;ve done so many different things that I can&rsquo;t even remember what to put into my portfolio. ;) From track, to solving whacky math problems, to building robots. I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that this was one of the most busy times of my life. I have spread my wings into so many different rooms that I honestly am a bit stuck. I haven&rsquo;t quite yet figured out what I want to do for a living anymore. But I don&#39;t think this is a problem. If I hadn&rsquo;t spanned across so many different activities I would never have gotten to experience my blood pumping through my head during my fastest 400 meter, or the thrill of getting those last few stories out during publishing nights, or the stress of a massive competition looming over and still not having a working robot and just putting in all the jank until it works. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of these different experiences have prepared us for what will come next. Where we expand a little further, learn more about our crafts, or just go straight into them. We will become that master craftsman and understand the intricacies of our industries. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">TAKING TIME TO IMPROVE:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the things that I really needed to reflect a lot about during the pandemic was myself, what I want to do, who I am, how I&rsquo;m going to get there. Now I may possibly only be speaking for myself here but I found the pandemic one of the greatest growing experiences of my life. I have been able to connect (all be it digitally) with many more people and had great experiences and really rich conversations during this time. I managed many more things at my own pace and some other things at an accelerated pace. And this was only because of ownership. Ownership is one of those things that has allowed me to do so well both in business and academica. The &ldquo;definition&rdquo; of ownership is: the act of possessing something. But I dont really like that one. I find ownership is feeling that you are responsible for that something. Sure it could be a mistake, but it could also be that project you are working on. Ownership is how I managed to learn college level multivariable calculus type stuff for my computer science class so I could make that better filter. NOBODY in their right minds who is just trying to pass that assignment would spend a week trying to implement a gaussian filter that can dynamically be changed in size to better make nixon more and less blurry. But because I felt I was responsible for getting this activity done, I did it anyway. This type of ownership extends far beyond La Salle. Employers are always looking for those people who have ownership. It is often a core principle in many companies because it is just such an important skill. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in summary we have the experience and the knowledge to shape what the world will be. So let&#39;s go do great things, and live la salle&rsquo;s motto &ldquo;Enter to learn, Leave to serve&rdquo;</span></p></body></html>
